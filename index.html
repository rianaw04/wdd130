            <p>Hi! I'm Riana. I'm from the small island of Antigua. 
                I spend a lot of my time at the beach, I love the ocean. I enjoy reading, coding, spending time with my family.
                I love photography, however I only ever take pictures of the clouds, 
                I love the clouds because they're so surreal and they're a reminder that as big as I may think something is, it really isn't.
                My favorite thing to do on island would have to be going to the beach, there's just so much to choose from!
                The beach is one of my happy places, it's always fun being at the beach</p>

            <p>Antigua and Barbuda is home of 365 beaches, one for every day of the year meanwhile Barbuda is filled with Pink Sand beaches. Both islands combine are a match made in Heaven. The islands are festive all year round but even more so during the summer, this is when the greatest summer fest is celebrated: Carnival.</p>
